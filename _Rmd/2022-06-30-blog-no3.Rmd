## ST 558 - Third Blog Post

After completing Topic 1 and Topic 2 for ST 558, the most interesting thing I learned about programming in R was about how straight-forwardly logical ggplot is. 

I know that this was the example, but genuinely for whatever reason the argument for ggplot over base R plotting hadn't ever quite landed for me. After completing Project 1 and using ggplot to plot a variety of pokemon data, my favorite graph I created was definitely the Pokemon BMI by Generation, and Type Boxplot.

![BMI/Generation/Type Barplot](https://maxwell-marion.github.io/project1-558/README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

Here is the code that I used to do it: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Creating plotting item and generating BMI
bmi_df <- all_pokemon %>% select(name, type_1, weight, height) %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight/(height^2)) %>% mutate(gen = NA)

# Establishing gen values
bmi_df$gen[1:151] <- "1"
bmi_df$gen[152:251] <- "2"

bmi_box <- ggplot(bmi_df, aes(x = gen, y = bmi))
bmi_box + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(aes(color = type_1), width = 0.3) + 
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Pokemon BMI by Generation\n(Gen. 1 and 2)",
       x = "Generation", y = "BMI", color = "Primary Type")
```


I also really appreciated how much the logic flows with piping in tidyverse. Gathering the variables of interest, creating a data frame, and mutating variables were all very straightforward and intuitive to me after diving a bit deeper into this system of doing things during this course.I'm looking forward to what we will learn in Topics 3 and 4!
