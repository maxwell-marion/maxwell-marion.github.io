**What do you think being a data scientist is about?**

*I think that being a data scientist is about bringing in, exploring, and processing data in a way that can provide value to whomever you are working for or with.*

**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**

*The major duties of a data scientist include processing and cleaning data, conducting some exploratory analysis, and then using the data to develop predictive tools. As far as knowledge areas for a data scientist - it seems as though the most commonly agreed upon necessities are statistical and programming knowledge, and domain specific knowledge.*

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**

*It seems as though both data scientists and statisticians should have a very solid foundation and understanding of statistical practices, however data scientists likely need to be very comfortable with programming generally (rather than just statistical programming) whereas statisticians seem to need a better understanding of academic or clinical research.*

**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**

*While I am very interested in statistics generally, I find it exciting and rewarding to pair statistical analysis with programming. Because of this, I think that if I had to lean towards one side or another, I would be more firmly in the data scientist camp.*
